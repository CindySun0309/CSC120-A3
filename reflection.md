Quinn

Sunday 1-3pm ï¼ˆChris), Sunday 7-9pm (Asher, Allison)
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Hard, and I am still confused by it.  
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The overall logic is similar, but the way to write them is totally different. In Java we do not need to be realy careful when formatting (indentation). 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Nothing really worked when I tried to do the assignment myself. I asked a lot of help and I am afraid of programing. The advice I would give to future student is to ask tutors' help. One-on-one help is helpful.
